Predict the outcome of a match:
-------------------------------

We need to take into amount a lot of variables and add a weight to each variable. e.g.: win/loss ratio of a team is more important than playing home or away.

Variables:
- win/loss ratio (divide this into recent/old)
- rank in competition
- playing home/away

(- good players in team? A lot of overhead; need to rank all players -> how to do this? Alternative: make a list with 50 top players in the world (e.g.: http://www.easports.com/fifa/news-updates-gameplay/article/fifa-14-top-50) and check if the team has one of these top players.)

Basic version could just say which team wins; advanced version could try and predict a concrete score.

Weights (1 is most important):
1. recent win/loss ratio (this season + last season?)
2. current rank
3. playing home/away


Tom's idea
----------

Divide the win/loss ratio in a home win/loss and an away win/loss.

Variables win/loss prediction:
- previous settled match outcomes between teams
	(perhaps divided in home and away again)
- home team: win/loss ratio at home
- out team: win/loss ratio when away
- current rank in the league
	
Variables score prediction:
- same setup scores
- switched around setup scores
- general results
	(keep in mind recent = better)
	
==> To all this we might add a player ranking for more precise results but certainly not neccesary.

PROBLEM: IN THE WC THERE IS NO HOME AND AWAY !
