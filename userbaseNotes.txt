Add some constrains in database level (for duplicate usernames etc)?

Registration code not yet enabled: needs ability to send emails.
Registration code is varchar length 24, to be set to empty once it is entered.
Now set to empty right away.

Registration field restrictions:
Username: required, min length 5, unique
First name, last name: required
Country: none (change to dropdown once country table is filled?)
Email address: required, must be email address (well yeah...), unique
Retype email: same as Email address
Password: required, min length 6, alphanumeric and _-
Retype password: same as password

Security is probably not secure against injections? (and thus not really security...?)

Login is now only remembered through a 2 hour cookie, so after 2 hours you get logged out.
Fix: "refresh" cookie on every pageview? Propagate some other way too?

Database stuff:
I have a Users database with only a user table
The database has a local user (by which I mean a user of the database, not an entry of the user table!)
named CoachCenter with password xSN2asvRPVU3Lrsa which is used to grant my php scripts access to the database.
This needs to be set by everyone separately to run the scripts locally.
Any better (and more secure?) options?
